# Rock-Paper-Scissors

**Re-create the famous hand game of rock paper scissors into a battle between the user and the computer.**

The rules are:
1)	A player who decides to play rock will beat the player which decides to play scissors, **“Rock crushes scissors”** and will beat a player which decides to play scissors **“Rock blunts scissors”.**

2)	A player who decides to play rock will lose against the player which decides to play paper **“Paper covers rock”**, whilst a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors **“Scissors cuts paper”.**

3)	If players decide to play similarly, the game it’s a **tie.**

**<ins>Hints:</ins>**
1. Create a list of play options. The are three possible plays “Rock”, “Paper” and “Scissors”.
2. Setup your players. Assign random play to the computer `randint (..)`
3. You can set up a count to keep track of the number of games, `count=1`
4. You can try and incorporate loops (while/for) and if statements (if/elif/else)
5. You can incorporate functions using `def (..)`
6. You might want to ensure what happens if the player inputs a wrong choice.
7. Make sure there is a way to end the game. For example you can use a boolean `isGameOver=True` alongside a while loop.
